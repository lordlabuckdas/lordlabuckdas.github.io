  <p>
  Hello there, I am Krishna, a security enthusiast. I'm passionate about Web Security and Open Source Software. I am currently an undergraduate student of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Patna</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I occasionally participate in CTFs with my team, <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/136490">SithLords</a> and also publish some <a href="https://github.com/lordlabuckdas/writeups/">cybersecurity write-ups</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also co-lead the cybersecurity division of the computer club of my college, <a href="https://njack.iitp.ac.in/">NJACK</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I absolutely love Vim (the text editor) and Pink Floyd.
