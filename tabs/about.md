---

**Hello there**, I'm a 2nd year Electrical and Electronics Engineering undergraduate from **Indian Institute of Technology, Patna**.

I am a security enthusiast. I'm currently working on Web Application PenTesting. I'm fascinated by DevSecOps. I participate in CTFs and also put up their write-ups here in my blog. You can check them out here.

My research interests include network security and cryptography.

I also co-lead the cybersecurity division of the computer club of my college, [NJACK](https://njack.iitp.ac.in).

Occasionally, I practice competitive programming and listen to Pink Floyd.

You can also reach out to me in Discord at `vastolorde#4259`.
