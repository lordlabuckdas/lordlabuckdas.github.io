**Hello there**, I'm a 2nd year Electrical and Electronics Engineering undergraduate from **Indian Institute of Technology, Patna**.

I am a security enthusiast. I participate in CTFs with my team, [SithLords](https://ctftime.org/team/136490) and also publish some write-ups [here](https://lordlabuckdas.github.io/writeups/).

I also co-lead the cybersecurity division of the computer club of my college, [NJACK](https://njack.iitp.ac.in).

I absolutely love Vim and Pink Floyd.

You can reach out to me at `krishnan_1901ee50[at]iitp[dot]ac[dot]in`.
