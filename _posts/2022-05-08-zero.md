After several iterations of this "first" blog post, I have come to a singlular conclusion - there is no final version. I will probably be re-writing this section months later cringing over these exact same lines. For now, I give up. This is the coolest first paragraph that I can think of.

I plan to blog about my experiences, findings and thoughts. Won't be 100% tech though. Will find some balance and post about other stuff related to football, movies and music too.

Cheers.
