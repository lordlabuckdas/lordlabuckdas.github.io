# origins lol

`zero, zip, zilch, nada` - all of these are synonyms of nothing. i chose that because what better way to signify a beginning (and the **batman** reference ofc)

~~i plan to post some write-ups for some CTFs~~ after trying it out for a few months, i realized it is not a good idea due to the sheer amount of clutter in my main website. so i decided to move onto a separate repo for it and maybe in the future, set up a jekyll blog without hindering the structure.

coming to what i'll be doing here, i definitely haven't figured that out; maybe some interesting stuff i come across, or about vim or about how great pink floyd is or about how classical music is underrated or better, a post about existential crisis.

**PS:** in case you are even a teeny-tiny bit interested as to what my username, `lordlabuckdas` stands for, you should definitely watch [this great piece of comedy](https://www.facebook.com/AdithyaTV/videos/415460759054409/) by [Vivek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_(actor)).
