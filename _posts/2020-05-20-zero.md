## origins lol

`zero, zip, zilch, nada` - all of these are synonyms of nothing. i chose that because what better way to signify a beginning (and the **batman** reference ofc)

~~i plan to post some write-ups for some CTFs~~ after trying it out for a few months, i realized it is not a good idea due to the sheer amount of clutter in my main website. so i decided to move onto a separate repo for it and maybe in the future, set up a jekyll blog without hindering the file system structure.

coming to what i'll be doing here, i definitely haven't figured that out; maybe some interesting stuff i come across, or cool stories behind my projects or about how vim saved me from 3hrs of mundane tasks or about how great of a band pink floyd is or about why dwm is the best wm ever or better yet, talk about why linux, git and containerization are some of the greatest achievements in tech.

**PS:** in case you are even a teeny-tiny bit interested as to what my username, `lordlabuckdas` stands for, you should definitely watch [this great piece of comedy](https://www.facebook.com/AdithyaTV/videos/415460759054409/) by [Vivek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_(actor)).
