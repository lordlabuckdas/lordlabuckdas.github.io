### origins lol

`zero, zip, zilch, nada` - all of these are synonyms are nothing. i chose that because **what better way to signify a beginning** (and the **batman** reference ofc)

if you've actually been following this blog or the repo, you'd know this is not my first post. why? because i suck at writing these stuff and keep procrastinating. in fact, the only reason i even write is because i hope to look back later and say, `eh, what a n00b`.

so i'm planning to put up some write-ups for CTFs that i do and maybe a few other things i find interesting here in this blog. so if you don't find a considerable amount of the aforementioned, just ping me to remind how much this idea sucks.

also, i thought i would explain what my username - `lordlabuckdas` - means. it is from a [great piece](https://www.facebook.com/AdithyaTV/videos/415460759054409/) of comedy by Tamil comedian, [Vivek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_(actor)). i also want to make it clear that i intend no disrespect or offense to any person or community.
