`Zero, Zip, Zilch, Nada` - some synonyms of nothing. I chose that because what better way to signify a beginning (and the **batman** reference ofc). `hello_world` is probably too cliche and overused at this point.

~~I plan to post some write-ups for some CTFs~~ After trying it out for a few months, the sheer amount of clutter in my main website made me realize it is probably not a good idea. Though I don't blog very often, I decided a separate repo for writeups would be better. Maybe in the future, I'll set up a Jekyll blog for it.

## Purpose

Coming to what I'll be doing here, I definitely haven't figured that out; maybe some interesting stuff I come across, or cool stories behind my projects or about how Vim saved me from 3hrs of mundane tasks or about how great of a band Pink Floyd is or about why DWM is the best WM ever or better yet, talk about why Linux, git and containerization are some of the greatest achievements in tech.
