> hey, you're finally awake! that hdd failure looked real bad. dotfiles? arch? what are you talking about? let's go update windows

## but, why?

contrary to the above joke, i actually made the switch to arch linux after using virtual machines for a year or so in windows. thus, my hdd failure was a bittersweet experience. i also went about using TUI applications extensively and configuring them as per my needs and **that** is what this blog post will be about.

## 'nuff said

[**link to dotfiles**](https://github.com/lordlabuckdas/dotfiles)

after losing all of my previous dotfiles, i realized it is high-time i make a [dotfiles repo](https://dotfiles.github.io/) for backup (and to flex it ofc).

oh, one thing to note - almost everything is dracula-based because it is undoubtedly the best theme to exist in this universe and anybody who disagrees can go back to their grumpbox or soyarized or oh-whats-the-comment-here nord.

in terms of a desktop environment, i have no desktop environment - window manager it is. dwm seemed to amazing with its keybinds and lightweighted-ness. ofc, i'm loving the experience now.

i use neovim for most text editing purposes, though i occasionally turn to vscode (read codium) for its amazing extensions. thanks to coc.nvim, i haven't had the need to open vscode for a few months now. i soon plan to shift to neovim's native lsp and lua.
