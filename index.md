Welcome my son,
Welcome to the machine
```

Hello, I'm Krishna, a senior-year undergraduate at IIT Patna.

I'm interested in databases, distributed systems and software development in general.

Find my Arch Linux config [here](https://github.com/lordlabuckdas/dotfiles) and an `opml` file of the feeds I follow [here](https://github.com/lordlabuckdas/lordlabuckdas.github.io/raw/main/feeds.opml).

You can contact me via my email - `krishnan_1901ee50[at]iitp[dot]ac[dot]in`.
