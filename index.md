Hello, I'm Krishna, a junior-year undergraduate at IIT Patna.

I'm interested in OSS and software security - web and network security in particular.

I participate in CTFs with my team, [SithLords](https://ctftime.org/team/136490) and publish writeups [here](https://github.com/lordlabuckdas/writeups/).

You can contact me via my email - `krishnan_1901ee50[at]iitp[dot]ac[dot]in`.
